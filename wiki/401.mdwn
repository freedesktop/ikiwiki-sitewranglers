# wiki.freedesktop.org: 401 Unauthorized

wiki.freedesktop.org has two authentication methods; one is through [[ssh access to fd.o shell accounts|http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/AccountRequests/]] (e.g. git+ssh://wiki.freedesktop.org/srv/ikiwiki/git/sitewranglers.git ), the other is over HTTPS (e.g. <https://secure.freedesktop.org/write/sitewranglers/ikiwiki.cgi?page=wiki%2F401&do=edit> ). 

To avoid problems with spammers, the htpasswd entries associated with HTTPS authentication involve manual administration.

If you have a freedesktop.org shell account, you can add or update any htpasswd entry: `ssh wiki.freedesktop.org wikipasswd INSERT_DESIRED_USERNAME_HERE`. Use your powers wisely; everything is logged under version control.

If you don't have a shell account, you should find a way to generate a hash and safely send it to the sitewranglers with a clearsigned signature that can be `gpg --verify`ed.

### Generation

* local shell:
    * `htpasswd -c -m /dev/stdout DesiredUsername` # and input your password at the prompts
* browser:
    * <https://secure.freedesktop.org/static/htpasswd.html>

(Note if you customize the hash mechanism: we are currently using Apache 2.2 and thus do not yet support bcrypt hashes.)

### Signing

* `gpg --clearsign`
* enter GPG passphrase
* paste htpasswd entry
* EOF with ctrl-d

### Transmission

* If you do not have an existing shell account, send your signed hash to wiki-requests@freedesktop.org.

### Sitewranglers

* With a root account on annarchy, append or replace the user's htpasswd entry in /etc/apache2/userdb.basic
