# Create a http://wiki.freedesktop.org/ account

To avoid problems with spammers, wiki.freedesktop.org uses manually compiled
htpasswd entries. If you want an account, you should find a way to generate a
hash and safely send it to the sitewranglers, preferably with a signature.

### Generation

* remote shell e.g. on annarchy:
    * `umask 0077`
    * `htpasswd -c -m ~/userdb.htpasswd DesiredUsername` # and input your password at the prompts
* local shell:
    * `htpasswd -c -m /dev/stdout DesiredUsername` # and input your password at the prompts
* browser:
    * <https://secure.freedesktop.org/static/htpasswd.html>

(Note if you customize the hash mechanism: we are currently using Apache 2.2 and thus do not yet support bcrypt hashes.)

### Signing

* `gpg --clearsign`
* enter GPG passphrase
* paste htpasswd entry
* EOF with ctrl-d

### Transmisison

* If you do not have an existing shell account, send your signed hash to sitewranglers on IRC ( irc://irc.freenode.net/ usernames jrayhawk or Mithrandir ) or by email ( jrayhawk@freedesktop.org, tfheen@freedesktop.org ).
* If you use an existing shell account (even someone else's) with which to put the htpasswd entry on Annarchy's filesystem somewhere we can find it, simply notify `sitewranglers@freedesktop.org`. Shell accounts have pre-established PGP trust.

### Application

* With a root account on annarchy, append the user's htpasswd entry to the /etc/apache2/userdb.basic file
