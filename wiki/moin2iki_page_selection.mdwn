# MoinMoin-to-Ikiwiki Selective Page Conversion

On Annarchy:

    PROJECT=www # Change as appropriate
    git clone /srv/ikiwiki/git/${PROJECT}.git ~/${PROJECT}
    cd ~/${PROJECT}
    moin2iki-import-page.sh PageName
    moin2iki-import-page.sh ADifferent/PageName
    git push

There may be some manual cleanup to be done on the page itself; the automatic conversion creates pretty ugly but mostly functional Markdown, but is quite bad at dealing with preformatted text.

You may want to read up on [[formatting|http://ikiwiki.info/ikiwiki/formatting/]], [[locally previewing files|preview]], and [[other Ikiwiki features|http://ikiwiki.info/features/]]

If the conversion script fails, you may want to investigate why or do the conversion by hand by poking around in `/srv/${PROJECT}.freedesktop.org/moin/data/pages/PageName`.
